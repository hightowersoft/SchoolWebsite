== README

School Website is an open source Ruby on Rails project that is designed to help schools set up an easy to manage yet highly customisable website.

The theory behind it is many CMS systems are too complicated for school staff to be able to manage, so with School Website we want to take the complexity out of it and make it more suited to how many school websites will be configured.

The project is just beginning, and we would love you to help with the project in any way you can.
